			<h2>Not Quite Crowd Funding</h2>
			<span class="byline">How to contribute to this site and/or get the prompt generator you want</span>
			</div>
		<p>Elizabeth Barette suggested  crowdfunding this website but, when I looked into it, it was going to be a bit too complex for the anticipated return.  However, I would love more people to use and extend the set of prompt generators we have here and so some kind of not-quite-crowdfunding framework seemed like a good idea</p>

				<h2>Points and Prizes</h2>
			<span class="byline">Not Quite Crowdfunding</span> </div>
		<p>This website operates on a points-based system.</p>  
		<p>You can gain points by contributing prompts to the site; promoting the site and using it in challenges and memes; or donating money to charities I support.</p>
			<p>You can spend points in getting customised online prompt generators set up for your personal use or a challenge you are running.</p>
			<p>A point notionally represents roughly 5 minutes of my time.</p>

	<h3><a name=support>Gaining Points</h3>
	<p>Please feel free to do any of these things simply to show support for the site</p>
	<ul >
	<li class="first">Creating a Public Prompt or Character List for general use (2 points)

	  <p>Generate a list of 20 or more prompts on some theme and send it to me (contact via LiveJournal or DreamWidth) for inclusion in the lists available for anyone to use in generating prompts.  Similarly send me a list of 20 or more characters from some fandom.  A public list can be used in any existing or future generator and may have prompts added by other people.</p>

<p>I reserve the right to reject lists if they are of very specific interest, overlap too much with existing lists, or I find them offensive.
</p>

</li>
				<li>Offering 10 extra prompts spread across existing lists (1 point)

	  <p>Make suggestions for additional prompts to be added to any of the existing public lists.  Lists which are not public are clearly marked as such.</p>

<p>I reserve the right to reject prompts if they are irrelevant to the suggested list, already exist in some list, or if I find them offensive.</p>
</li>
				<li>Using one of my Prompt Generators in a public challenge (2 points + 1 point for a public link)

<p>This can either be one of the existing generators, or a new custom generator.  PM me a link to the challenge to claim the points.  There is an additional point for a favourable mention of this site in the challenge information and a link here.</p>
</li>
				<li><a href=#promo>Promoting this page to a public community (2 points)</a><p>To claim PM me the link.</p></li>
				<li><a href=#promo>Promoting this page on your personal blog (1 point)</a><p>To claim PM me the link.</p></li>
				<li>Donating Â£5 to one of my charities (2 points)

				<p>To claim points please PM me to let me know you've made a donation.  I'll then let you have details for where to send a copy of your receipt.</p>
				<ul class="style1">
				  <li><a href=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/giving/donate/give-now>Amnesty International</a></li>
				  <li><a href=http://www.dsmig.org.uk/cookbook/index.html>The Downs Syndrome Medical Interest Group</a></li>
				  <li><a href=http://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/donate/>Help for Heroes</a></li>
				  <li><a href=http://www.msf.org.uk/make-a-donation>Medecins San Frontieres</a></li>
				  <li><a href=https://secure.savethechildren.org.uk/donate/>Save the Children</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.trusselltrust.org/donate">The Trussell Trust</a></li>
				</ul>
<p>NB. Some of these are easier to donate to than others</p>
</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>Spending Points</h3>
				<p>PM me at DreamWidth with details of what you would like.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="first">Creating a Specific Prompt Generator from an existing Template (1 point + 1 for each additional non-public list + 1 for each amended existing list)
<p>This means creating a new generator simply by adding or removing lists and/or character categories from one of the existing prompt generators.  This can then be made available at either a public URL linked from the main page for anyone to use, or at a private URL which only the requester will know about.</p>

<p>You may supply generator specific lists, however if you do not want these lists to be public (i.e., available for use in other generators, and available for additional prompt submission) then each additional list will cost an extra point.</p>

<p>Similarly if you want to use an existing list but with the addition or removal of some prompts then each modified list will cost an additional point.</p>
</li>

<li>Modifying an existing prompt generator which you own.  (1 point per 5 existing lists added/removed + 1 point per new non public list added + 1 for each amended existing list)

<p>If you already own a prompt generator (e.g., one used for a previous challenge) and want a modification to it for a new round or challenge then switching in or out up to five lists costs 1 point.  Other modifications (addition of non-public lists, modifications to existing lists cost as per creating a new prompt generator).</p>

<li>Adding new output formats for a prompt generator (2 points minimum)

<p>If you want the prompt generated in a format that isn't currently available in a way that is suitable for cutting-and-pasting into some particular web interface then this will (probably) cost 2 points.  It may cost more if the customisation proves to be tricky.</p></li>

<li>Creating new templates (Depends upon the work involved - minimum 3 points)

<p>If you want something that is similar to, but a little different from the existing prompt generators (e.g., with different distributions of prompts (all bingo cards seek to distribute prompts more or less equally from the lists);  different mechanisms for selecting categories; different layout formats) then that will cost a minimum of 3 points to produce.  It may cost more depending upon how complex the customisation is.</p>
</li>


<li>Priority Customisation (any of the above with guaranteed completion within 1 week - double the initial points).  I will attempt to handle all requests promptly (within 24 hours for simple changes) but can not, in the general way of things, guarantee completion in a week.  Priority Customisation will guarantee that anything you want done gets moved to the top of the queue and attended to immediately.  Obviously, in exceptional circumstances, completion within a week may not be possible (especially for more time consuming customisations), if this happens you will be informed as soon as possible.</li>

                  <p>Contact me initially via PM on LiveJournal or DreamWidth (see bottom of page).  I will probably then move things to email so include an email address if possible.</p>
		 <h3><a name=promo>Promotion Guidelines</h3>
				<p>By promoting I mean making a post that mentions this site in a positive fashion in an online space.  You can promote the page multiple times if you wish, but you will only earn points once per month.  To claim points please PM me a link to the promotional post.</p>
