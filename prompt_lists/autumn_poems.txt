Lines from Autumn Poems
1. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
2. Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun
3. Conspiring with him how to load and bless
4. With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run
5. To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees
6. And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core
7. To swell the gourd
8. and plump the hazel shells With a sweet kernel
9. to set budding more, and still more, later flowers for the bees
10. Until they think warm days will never cease
11. For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells
12. Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
13. Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor
14. Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind
15. Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep
16. Drows'd with the fume of poppies
17. while thy hook Spares the next swath
18. and all its twined flowers
19. And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep Steady thy laden head across a brook
20. Or by a cyder-press
21. with patient look
22. Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours
23. Where are the songs of Spring?
24. Ay, where are they?
25. Think not of them
26. thou hast thy music too
27. While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day
28. And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue
29. Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
30. Among the river shallows
31. borne aloft
32. Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies
33. And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn
34. Hedge-crickets sing
35. and now with treble soft
36. The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft
37. And gathering swallows twitter in the skies
38. Autumn is like an old book
39. Marred spines turn mean yellow
40. staples rust red-orange
41. Every stained page is stressed by a splat of color
42. Rough-red
43. like an old tavern
44. we become hungry birds and prepare for fall
45. Shape and shadow are candied citron
46. as lanterns turn bitter yellow
47. Autumn is a red fox
48. a goblet filled with dark wine
49. a hot chilli pepper with smoky eyes
50. Pressed leaves take in the colors of seafood paella and saffron
51. these leaves are like death
52. climaxing with a smile
53. Autumn: Her dress is a net of mussels, dark shelled
54. it covers up summer's weatherbeaten body
55. So pull out your boots
56. .and stand on an aged, wood floor
57. like an evergreen
58. I shall be Autumn
59. this Halloween,
60. with leaf draped skirt
61. and folds of boysenberry velvet wine
62. flowing to the ground
63. Brown stained face
64. eyes rimmed in gold
65. nails dripping sunset
66. a crown of twigs to cover my head
67. You may gather from me
68. the spring of my youth
69. my summer of maturity
70. and hold onto with me
71. the solace of these days
72. of remembering
73. before the frost
