Lines from Christmas, Solstice and Winter Songs and Poems
1. A cold coming we had of it
2. Just the worst time of the year for a journey
3. and such a long journey
4. The ways deep and the weather sharp
5. The very dead of winter
6. And the camels galled, sore-footed, refractory
7. Lying down in the melting snow
8. There were times we regretted
9. The summer palaces on slopes
10. the terraces
11. and the silken girls bringing sherbet
12. Then the camel men cursing and grumbling
13. and running away
14. and wanting their liquor and women
15. and the night-fires going out
16. and the lack of shelters
17. and the cities hostile
18. and the towns unfriendly
19. and the villages dirty
20. and charging high prices
21. a hard time we  had of it
22. at the end we preferred to travel all night
23. sleeping in snatches
24. With the voices singing in our ears
25. saying that this was all folly
26. Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley
27. wet, below the snow line
28. smelling of vegetation
29. With a running stream
30. and a water-mill beating the darkness
31. and three trees on the low sky
32. And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow
33. Then we came to a tavern
34. with vine-leaves over the lintel
35. Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver
36. And feet kicking the empty wine-skins
37. But there was no information
38. and so we continued
39. and arrived at evening
40. not a moment too soon
41. Finding the place
42. it was (you may say) satisfactory
43. All this was a long time ago, I remember
44. and I would do it again
45. but set down this set down this
46. were we led all that way for Birth or Death?
47. There was a Birth, certainly
48. We had evidence and no doubt
49. I had seen birth and death
50. But had thought they were different
51. this Birth was hard and bitter agony for us
52. like Death, our death
53. We returned to our places
54. these Kingdoms
55. But no longer at ease here
56. in the old dispensation
57. With an alien people clutching their gods
58. I should be glad of another death
59. I have news for you
60. The stag bells
61. winter snows
62. summer has gone
63. wind high and cold
64. the sun low, short its course
65. The sea running high
66. Deep red the bracken
67. its shape lost
68. The wild goose has raised its accustomed cry
69. cold has seized the birds' wings
70. season of ice
71. With solstice here we'll celebrate
72. This sacred time
73. and have much cheer
74. We will bring warmth
75. and we'll bring light
76. unto the darkest time of year
77. The mistletoe will be cut down
78. With sickle from the sacred tree
79. A kiss I'll give to you my love
80. A pledge of friendship made to thee
81. For greater than the will of man
82. or want of that which can be done
83. It fall and shines on where we stand
84. Beneath the great unconquered sun
85. For this is now our turning point
86. The shortest day, the longest night
87. We'll look unto the months to come
88. When the sun will grow both strong and bright
89. A vessel crown
90. all decked with green
91. That tell's of winter's tales and mirth
92. Will bring great gladness and much joy
93. To all who walk upon this earth
94. The servants and the lords alike
95. And masters they will feast with slaves
96. And give them freedom they desire
97. Set thief and scoundrel free this day
98. With candles, dolls and gifts of fruit
99. And blackened faces
100. through the street
101. We'll praise good fortune
102. raise our cups
103. And drink a toast
104. To kind and queen
105. We'll burn the lamps
106. to ward away the spirits
107. in the halls of those whose house all be decked with boughs
108. Where evergreen and laurel grows
109. The earth's white crust
110. where it lay down
111. Does bow the oaken branch
112. to fall
113. 'tis soltice now
114. account ye sins
115. repent ye
116. beggars one and all
